              To speak English fluently, you must practice speaking it as much as possible. This is true for any language: consistent practice is the key to improvement. Therefore, Gaven encourages students to speak English as much as possible, even if they make many mistakes. Gaven can assess a student's English skill level and provide targeted support to improve their weaknesses through engaging, interactive lessons.
