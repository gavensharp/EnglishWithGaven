      <h2 class="fs-5 mb-3">What are Prepositions?</h2>
      <p>Prepositions are words that connect verbs or nouns or pronouns with other words in a sentence to form prepositional phrases. These phrases provide extra details about time, place, or direction. Understanding how prepositions work with verbs and nouns helps clarify the meaning of a sentence, making your speaking and writing more accurate.</p>
