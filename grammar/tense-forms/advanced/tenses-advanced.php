            <h2 class="fs-5 mb-3">Mastering Complex Temporal Relationships</h2>
            <p>At the advanced level, understanding tenses goes far beyond simply identifying when an action occurs. It involves mastering the subtle interplay between different time frames, understanding how tenses create narrative cohesion, and using sophisticated temporal expressions to convey precise meaning. Advanced tense usage is essential for academic writing, professional communication, and literary expression.</p>
            <p>This level focuses on complex tense sequences, mixed conditionals, narrative tenses, backshifting in reported speech, and the nuanced differences between similar tense forms. Mastery of these structures allows you to express intricate temporal relationships with precision and sophistication.</p>

            <h2 class="fs-5 mb-3">Advanced Tense Structures</h2>
            <p>Advanced tense usage encompasses several sophisticated structures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mixed Conditionals:</strong> Combining different time frames in conditional sentences to express complex hypothetical situations. Example: <em>If I had studied harder (past), I would be more confident now (present).</em></li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Tenses:</strong> Using past perfect, past perfect continuous, and past simple together to create cohesive narratives with multiple time layers. Example: <em>She had been waiting for hours when he finally arrived, having forgotten about their appointment.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Future in the Past:</strong> Expressing future actions from a past perspective using "would," "was going to," or "was about to." Example: <em>He didn't know that his life was about to change forever.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Tense Sequences in Reported Speech:</strong> Understanding backshifting and when to maintain original tenses in indirect speech. Example: <em>She said she had finished the report (backshift) vs. The teacher said that water boils at 100°C (permanent truth).</em></li>
                <li><strong>Aspectual Distinctions:</strong> Understanding how perfect and continuous aspects interact to create precise meanings. Example: <em>I have lived here for 10 years (still living) vs. I have been living here for 10 years (emphasis on duration/temporary).</em></li>
                <li><strong>Stative vs. Dynamic Verbs:</strong> Recognizing which verbs can and cannot be used in continuous forms, and understanding exceptions. Example: <em>I'm having dinner (dynamic) vs. I have a car (stative).</em></li>
                <li><strong>Historical Present:</strong> Using present tenses to create immediacy when recounting past events. Example: <em>So I'm walking down the street when suddenly this guy comes up to me...</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="fs-5 mb-3">Complex Tense Functions and Nuances</h2>
            <p>Let's explore the sophisticated functions and distinctions in advanced tense usage:</p>

            <h3 class="fs-6 mb-2 mt-4">Mixed Conditionals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past condition → Present result:</strong> If I had taken that job (but I didn't), I would be living in Paris now.</li>
                <li><strong>Present condition → Past result:</strong> If I were more organized (but I'm not), I wouldn't have missed the deadline.</li>
                <li><strong>Past condition → Future result:</strong> If she had accepted the offer, she would be starting next week.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fs-6 mb-2 mt-4">Narrative Tense Sequences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect for earlier background:</strong> She realized she had left her phone at home (action before main narrative).</li>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous for duration before past:</strong> They had been traveling for 12 hours when they finally reached the border.</li>
                <li><strong>Past Simple for main narrative events:</strong> He opened the door and walked inside.</li>
                <li><strong>Past Continuous for atmosphere/background:</strong> The sun was setting as they approached the city.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fs-6 mb-2 mt-4">Future in the Past</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"would" for future from past perspective:</strong> She didn't know she would become famous.</li>
                <li><strong>"was going to" for past plans:</strong> I was going to call you, but I forgot.</li>
                <li><strong>"was about to" for imminent past action:</strong> The show was about to start when the power went out.</li>
                <li><strong>"was to" (formal) for destined events:</strong> This was to be their last meeting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fs-6 mb-2 mt-4">Reported Speech Complexities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backshifting:</strong> "I am tired" → She said she was tired.</li>
                <li><strong>No backshift for permanent truths:</strong> He said the Earth revolves around the Sun (not "revolved").</li>
                <li><strong>No backshift for recent speech:</strong> She's just told me she feels better (not "felt").</li>
                <li><strong>Modal backshifting:</strong> can → could, will → would, may → might</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fs-6 mb-2 mt-4">Important Distinctions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Perfect vs. Present Perfect Continuous:</strong> "I have read the book" (completed) vs. "I have been reading the book" (ongoing/recently finished with emphasis on activity).</li>
                <li><strong>Past Simple vs. Present Perfect:</strong> "I lived in Paris for 3 years" (finished period) vs. "I have lived in Paris for 3 years" (still living there).</li>
                <li><strong>Past Perfect vs. Past Simple:</strong> When the sequence is clear from context, past simple can replace past perfect: "After he finished dinner, he watched TV" (sequence clear without "had finished").</li>
                <li><strong>Will vs. Going to:</strong> "I'll help you" (spontaneous decision) vs. "I'm going to help you" (planned intention).</li>
            </ul>
